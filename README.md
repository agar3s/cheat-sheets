cheat-sheets
============

Create and sometimes share your own cheat sheets, like the ip of some server, or your company's id

Usually I need a lot of information that I just don't remember and I think that have
a list of global "variables" like in code, it is a good way to index and find my
list of data.

I'm using Flask 0.9
